I am a computer science major and music minor at Carleton College. I was drawn to this capstone project by my ongoing fascination with AI and machine learning. I enjoyed the opportunity to explore this fascinating branch of machine learning and hope to use it in future projects. In my free time I enjoy composing and making music, playing chess and 8-ball, and working on my personal programming projects.
